                I miss driving in the HOV
                Just you and me
                No hurry
                I miss dinners that we wouldn't eat
                'Cause it wasn't cheap
                No worries
                I miss all the little things that we did, but didn't notice
                You never know a good thing until it's gone
                I miss driving in the HOV
                Now life moves somewhat slowly

                Yeah
                Thinking back on the day when we packed the Jetta
                Drove to the unknown, we don't know no better
                You and me against the world, it's the new vendetta
                Was the only thing sane to do (sane to do)
                Type of mood swing that could change the weather
                Hot, cold, hot, cold, sweating through my sweater
                Back and forth, back and forth, how a tie get severed
                Was the only way to cut you loose (only way to cut you loose)
                No U-turns
                My fault that I put you first
                Broken heart, you took two thirds
                Guess that makes me a loser, huh?
                Zero mileage
                Brand new speakers, driving
                Still I sit in silence
                Thinking about you
            </p>

                I remember the day I said "I love you" and you said it back
                Guess you happy now, how could I be upset with that
                Go from talking every day to no message back
                How we go from letting me pay to a separate tab?
                You even met my parents
                Before you flew the coup
                You made me think of marriage
                Just like the movies do
                My momma said I had a good one
                My pops said it too
                I told them 'bout the one that got away
                But never told them it was you, you, you
                All that time, yeah, it was you, you, you</p>
